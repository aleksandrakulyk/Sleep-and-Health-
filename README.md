# Sleep-and-Health-


The project aimed to uncover insights into how different variables such as gender, age, occupation, and stress levels influence sleep quality and 
overall health. A/B test was conducted to test how physical activity affects sleep duration.

#General Information

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of sleep and health data using Jupyter Notebook to investigate patterns and correlations between various health metrics and demographic factors. The project aimed to uncover insights into how different variables such as gender, age, occupation, and stress levels influence sleep quality and overall health.

#Setup
Please install Jupyter Notebook to run the code. Import pandas to be able to perform analysis and plotly.express to be able to visualize it.

#Usage
Install Jupyter Notebook using pip and writing below code in terminal:

pip install jupyterlab
Import matplotlib.pyplot as pltand pandas as pd coding below at the very beggining:
